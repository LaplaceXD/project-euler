# Project Euler

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more
than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient
methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

## Motivation

This is just a compilation of all my [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) solutions. This also helps
me keep track how far I have gone in competitive programming. All of the solutions would be written in
`C/C++`.
