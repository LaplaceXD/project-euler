# Project Euler

This is just a compilation of all my Project Euler solutions. This also helps me keep track how far I have
gone in competitive programming. All of the solutions would be written in `C/C++`.

## Problems

1. [Multiples of 3 and 5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1)

## Usage

Fork this repo to get access to the source code, and make sure your pc supports `C/C++`.
